This video is an overview of the project with visualizations.


My TDI capstone project new path finder uses remote sensing and webscraping to help answer the question what happens to people’s daily lives when borders and boundaries change.  Particularly, how do new paths form when old paths are obstructed by new boundaries and moving borders.  
<br>
This project began by scraping news websites and international organization reports in multiple languages to identify hundreds of locations where borders and boundaries have moved in the last 10 years in Georgia and Ukraine. 
<br>
Using google earth engine I’ve processed over 60 gb of time sequenced hyperspectral remotely sensed data for larger supervised and unsupervised classifications.  Ultimately, the final product predicts and identifies the appearance of new pathways and predicts possible outcomes when borders change.
